# FuzzingBrain Bench

**A capability-ladder benchmark for LLM-driven vulnerability reproduction on
77 real zero-day bugs across 43 open-source projects (C / C++ / Java).**

Each challenge gives the agent only the **fuzz harness** (the target) and the
project source at the vulnerable revision — no patch, no fix commit, no target
line. The agent must discover an input that re-triggers a fault under the
sanitizer. Every grade is **deterministic** (no LLM-as-judge) and happens
**in-image and offline**: the candidate runs through the official
sanitizer-instrumented harness baked into the challenge container, and the run
is scored by the distinct crashes the agent triggered. Nothing leaves the
machine and no service has to be up.

| Challenges | Projects | Languages | Grader |
|---|---|---|---|
| **77** end-to-end | **43** | C · C++ · Java | deterministic — in-image, offline |

Nothing in the images or this repository reveals what a bug is — challenges are
named by neutral alias (`<project>-NN`, e.g. `avro-03`), and the answer key
(PoC, expected fault, fixed build) is in neither: it stays with the maintainer.

## Quick start

### 1. Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OwenSanzas/FuzzingBrain-Bench
cd FuzzingBrain-Bench

python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # recommended (and required on
                                                     # Debian/Ubuntu, PEP 668)
pip install -e .                              # needs Python ≥ 3.10 and Docker

# put your model key(s) in ./.env — auto-loaded on every run, no need to export
cat > .env <<'EOF'
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
EOF

fb-bench list                                 # the 77 challenges (by alias)
fb-bench models                               # supported models + which keys are loaded
```

(`./.env` is read automatically; a plain `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` also works.)

> Re-`source .venv/bin/activate` in each new shell. Or skip the venv with
> `pip install --break-system-packages -e .` (not recommended).

`fb-bench run` pulls the public challenge image, drives the agent loop on the
host (calling your model API), and grades every candidate **inside that image** —
no network, nothing to reach. Only Docker + your model key are required, and a
run scores the **distinct crashes** the agent found — a crash's identity is its
sanitizer fault type plus its top stack frames, so the same fault hit twenty
times counts once.

> The default `--arm api` needs nothing beyond the above. The `--arm codex` and
> `--arm claudecode` backends need extra **vendor CLIs — optional**, installed
> separately (never part of `pip install -e .`); see [§4](#4-agent-modes--same-run-pick-the-backend-with---arm).

### 2. Run one challenge with a model

```bash
# Claude family  (haiku is cheapest/fastest; swap in opus/sonnet for harder runs)
fb-bench run avro-03 --model claude-haiku-4-5

# GPT family
fb-bench run avro-03 --model gpt-5.5

# Gemini family
fb-bench run avro-03 --model gemini-3-pro-preview

# DeepSeek family  (OpenAI-compatible endpoint; needs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)
fb-bench run avro-03 --model deepseek-v4-flash
```

Models: `claude-haiku-4-5` · `claude-sonnet-4-6` · `claude-opus-4-7` ·
`gpt-5.5` · `gpt-5.4` · `gpt-5` · `gemini-3-pro-preview` · `gemini-2.5-flash` ·
`deepseek-v4-pro` · `deepseek-v4-flash`
(any catalog id works via `--model`; see `fb-bench models`).

### 3. Run many — same command, one or many

`fb-bench run` takes one bug or many, one model or many. A single run is just a
matrix of size one, so there is no separate "sweep" command:

```bash
# recommended full run: one model over the whole corpus, named output, PoCs
# preserved (the default) for later inspection. The agent keeps hunting past its
# first solve unless you pass --stop-on-solve
fb-bench run all --model claude-haiku-4-5 --output run1 --max-turns 100

# the curated cross-model roster, all challenges, 4 cells in parallel
fb-bench run all --model default-lineup --output sweep1 --jobs 4

# a couple of bugs, 3 samples each
fb-bench run avro-03,jq-01 --model gpt-5.5 --samples 3 --output probe

# just re-print the leaderboard from an existing run
fb-bench run all --model claude-haiku-4-5 --output run1 --report-only
```

`<bugs>` is one alias, a comma list, or `all`; `--model` is one id, a comma list,
`default-lineup`, or `all`. Results land in `output/<name>/<bug>/<model>/seed-N/`
(`score.json`, `episode.jsonl`, `transcript.jsonl`, `cost.json`, distilled
`traj.md`); a leaderboard is printed at the end. `--output` takes a bare name
(nested under `output/`) or a path (used as-is). **Every run gets its own
folder**: omit `--output` and it lands in `output/run_<timestamp>`; name a folder
that already exists and a fresh run forks `<name>_<timestamp>` rather than
resuming into it — so two runs never share results (`--report-only` is the one
reader, opening a folder in place).

### 4. Agent modes — same `run`, pick the backend with `--arm`

The three agent backends share **one entry**. `--arm` selects which one drives
the challenge; everything else (`<bugs>`, `--jobs`, `--samples`, `--output`,
the per-run folder, the leaderboard) is identical across arms.

```bash
fb-bench run avro-03 --model gpt-5.5            # --arm api (default): provider model
fb-bench run avro-03 --arm codex               # OpenAI codex CLI (default gpt-5.5)
fb-bench run avro-03 --arm claudecode --model sonnet --auth sub   # Claude Code CLI
fb-bench run all     --arm codex --jobs 4      # whole corpus, batched
```

- **`--arm codex`** drives OpenAI's `codex exec` over the bench MCP server.
  `--model` sets the codex model (default `gpt-5.5`), pinned via its config.toml.
- **`--arm claudecode`** drives the Claude Code CLI. `--model` picks the claude
  model (`sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku`).

Both vendor arms take **`--auth {api,sub}`**: `api` = the provider API key
(`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, pay-go, no throttle), `sub` = a
subscription sign-in (codex: a ChatGPT **Plus/Pro/Business/Edu/Enterprise** plan;
claudecode: claude.ai OAuth). Default is **auto** — prefer `api` when the API key
is present, else fall back to `sub`.

#### Optional — install the vendor CLI for the arm you use

These are **optional extras** and are **not** installed by `pip install -e .`.
The default `--arm api` never needs them. Install only the CLI whose arm you plan
to run (both need Node):

```bash
# --arm codex → OpenAI Codex CLI. Authenticate once, matching the --auth you use:
npm install -g @openai/codex
#   --auth api (default when OPENAI_API_KEY is set):
printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | codex login --with-api-key
#   --auth sub (needs a ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Business/Edu/Enterprise plan; a free
#   ChatGPT account can't use the codex models):
codex login                                  # sign in with your ChatGPT plan

# --arm claudecode → Claude Code CLI.
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
#   --auth api (default when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set): nothing to do
#   --auth sub: one-time claude.ai OAuth login
claude
```

## Scan modes: `full` and `delta-0…3`

How much context the agent is handed defines the difficulty:

| Mode | The agent sees | Turn budget | Runs against |
|---|---|---|---|
| **blind** (default) | harness + source only — **no description**; find the crash cold | 100 | public images |
| **delta-0 … delta-3** | additionally the crash-region file, mixed with **0/1/2/3** distractor files | **50** | private eval harness |

The public benchmark is **always blind**: the bug description is withheld and the
agent must find a crashing input from the harness and source alone (there is no
other public mode). The `delta-N` levels are the **research evaluation protocol**:
they localize a hint down to the crash-region file, which is derived from the
answer key, so they run in the maintainer's private harness, not against the
sealed public images.

## What a run scores

**Distinct crashes.** A crash's identity is its sanitizer fault type plus its top
stack frames, so the same fault reached twenty times counts once, and repeats
across a challenge's samples collapse into one.

Deciding whether a crash is *the* defect a challenge was built around needs an
answer key — the PoC, the documented fault, a build at the fix commit — and no
image ships one. So a run can tell you an input crashed, and whether that crash
is one it had not produced before, but not that it crashed the *right* way.

Each `bench.yaml` still declares a `capability_set`; it is read by the research
eval protocol below, and is not scored here.

## Other parameters

```bash
fb-bench run <bugs> \
    --model gpt-5.5 \         # one id, comma list, default-lineup, or all
    --max-turns 100 \         # turn budget per episode
    --timeout 1800 \          # per-episode wall-clock seconds
    --jobs 4 \                # run N cells in parallel
    --samples 3 \             # repeat each (model, bug) N times
    --output my-experiment \  # results under output/my-experiment/ (name or path)
    --no-preserve-pocs \      # graded blobs are KEPT by default; pass this to drop them
    --stop-on-solve           # end at the first crash; off by default, so an
                              # episode keeps hunting for more distinct crashes
```

Grade a hand-crafted or external (AFL++ / libFuzzer / honggfuzz) PoC without any
LLM — the grader is vendor-neutral:

```bash
fb-bench grade <alias> my-input.bin        # -v for the evidence
```

---

## How it works (sealed challenges)

Every challenge is a public, **answer-free** Docker image. The agent talks to it
over an MCP server (`setup` / `exec` / `run_poc_on_harness`);
`run_poc_on_harness()` runs the candidate through the sanitizer harness and
returns only what the harness printed plus whether that crash is one this episode
has already produced — never an answer key.

```
docker.io/osanzas/fbbench-challenge-<alias>:latest      # one image per challenge
```

One image, one tag, and it judges itself. It carries the sanitizer-instrumented
harness built from the source it already ships, the crash-signature rules, and a
pre-built mcp-server that can grade, so a run needs no network at all. What it
does not carry is any answer: no reference PoC, no expected fault, no build at the
fix commit, nothing that says where the defect is — the harness is compiled from
source the image publishes anyway, so the image is worth no more to someone
reading it than that source already is. The seal architecture and the answer-free
verifier live in [`tools/sealed/`](tools/sealed/) — anyone can audit that no
answer key ships with an image:

```bash
python tools/sealed/verify_sealed.py docker.io/osanzas/fbbench-challenge-avro-03:latest
```

## What's in this repo

```
bugs/<project>/<alias>/   one challenge: fuzz harness + neutral metadata
                          (project, language, sanitizer, harness interface)
fbbench/                  the CLI + run engine + codex / claude-code arms
tools/sealed/             challenge index + answer-free image verifier
```

The answer artifacts (PoC inputs, expected-fault keys, the build at the fix
commit) are **not** in this repository and not in the images either — they stay
with the maintainer. Which is why a run can tell you that an input crashed, and
whether that crash is one it had not produced before, but not that it crashed the
*right* way.
