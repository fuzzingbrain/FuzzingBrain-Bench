"""Checks for signature.py — the rules that decide which crash a run produced.

signature.py is a COPY of the grading backend's rules, and the backend has the
authoritative tests that pin them to all 68 crash logs in the answers repo. This
file exists for the other risk: the copy silently drifting from the original, in
a repo where nothing else would notice. So it asserts the properties the score
depends on rather than re-deriving the corpus.

    two faults of different kinds at one site are two crashes
    one fault reached two ways is two crashes
    frames that belong to the sanitizer, the allocator or the driver are not
        the bug and never identify it
    a clean run has no signature at all

Both the top-level `canon_sig` (the key everything is counted by) and the
readable `sig_text` are checked: the joined key is what dedups, and the text is
the same components spaced out for reading.
