// the vuln commit. That is enough to answer the only question this benchmark
// now asks — "did this input crash, and is it a crash this run has not produced
// before?" — so no answer key ships: no expected.yaml, no coverage build, no
// fixed-commit build, and therefore nothing in the image says where the defect
// is. An image is worth exactly as much to someone reading it as the upstream
// source already is.
//
// The five-rung capability ladder (reach / crash / differential / class / site)
// is deliberately NOT implemented here, and cannot be: every rung past `crash`
// needs the answer key — the PoC, the documented fault, a build at the fix
// commit — and none of that ships in an image. Scoring is distinct crashes.
