"""Build a self-contained, answer-free sweep summary page.

After a sweep, :func:`write_summary` injects a params+results blob into
``summary_template.html`` and writes ``<output>/index.html`` — a double-clickable
matrix of every (bug x model) cell, each linking to that episode's own report.

ANSWER SAFETY: the summary reads only each cell's ``score.json`` (the agent's
achieved tier + which ladder flags fired + its own crash signatures + cost +
terminated reason). It never opens ``expected.yaml`` / ``poc`` / a description,
and emits no bug class or crash location. "solved" is derived purely from the
cell's own capabilities (every applicable, non-``n/a`` flag fired) — so no
answer key is consulted. Crash signatures are the AGENT's findings, distilled
from harness output it had already seen; they say what it hit, never what it was
supposed to hit.
