"""Per-model API pricing -> USD cost for an episode.

Rates are USD per 1,000,000 tokens (standard tier). EDIT FREELY — prices change;
verify against the provider before quoting these numbers.

Anthropic rates VERIFIED 2026-09-16 against
https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing — every Claude entry
below matches the published list price on that date. The other providers are
still the May 2026 figures and several are marked ESTIMATE; they have not been
re-checked, so treat a non-Anthropic total as indicative.

Three published modifiers this file does NOT model, because nothing here uses
them. Each would make a real run cost MORE than we report, so they are named
rather than silently assumed away:
  * 1-hour cache writes are 2x base input, not the 1.25x of a 5-minute write.
    We use 5-minute caching (an `ephemeral` cache_control with no ttl), so 1.25
    is right for our runs and wrong for anyone who switches.
  * Fast mode (Opus 5 / Opus 4.8) is $10/$50, double standard. Reported cost
    would be half the truth on a fast-mode run.
  * inference_geo="us" is 1.1x on Claude 4.6 and later. Global is the default.
Batch (-50%) is likewise not modelled and would make a run cost LESS.

cost_usd() prices prompt-caching correctly when the backend reports cache
buckets: fresh input at 1x, cache WRITE at the provider's write multiplier,
cache READ at the provider's (much cheaper) read multiplier. Reasoning/thinking
tokens are billed as output and are included. Batch discounts are not modeled.

# Per-provider prompt-cache multipliers, applied to the INPUT rate.
#   read  = cache hit  (re-reading an already-cached prefix)
#   write = cache create (the first turn a prefix is cached; a one-time surcharge
#           on the newly-written tokens; providers that auto-cache have none)
# Anthropic: documented 0.1x read / 1.25x write. OpenAI auto-caches with a ~0.1x
# read and no write surcharge. Gemini implicit cache ~0.25x read. EDIT to match
# the provider's current published cache pricing.
# DeepSeek auto-caches on disk: cache-hit input is ~0.25x the miss rate, no
# write surcharge. It reports hits under usage.prompt_cache_hit_tokens (the
# OpenAI backend maps that into the cache_read bucket).
# Open-model API providers auto-cache like DeepSeek/OpenAI (cheap read, no write
# surcharge); ollama is local (free) so its multipliers are irrelevant. Unlisted
# providers fall back to the 0.10 read / 1.0 write defaults in cost_usd().
# Per-MODEL overrides, for the cases a per-provider multiplier cannot express.
# Fable 5.1 and Mythos 5.1 read cache at 0.025x, not the 0.1x every other Claude
# model uses. Without this, adding Fable 5.1 to PRICES would overprice its cache
# reads fourfold -- and on a cached agent run, cache reads ARE the bill.
