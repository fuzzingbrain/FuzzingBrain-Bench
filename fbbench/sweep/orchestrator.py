"""The run engine behind `fb-bench run`.

`run_matrix()` runs a (models x bugs x samples) matrix through
`python -m fbbench.runner`, one episode per subprocess (isolated + per-episode
timeout), resumable (skips cells whose score.json already exists), with a live
cost tally and a final leaderboard. A single run is just a size-1 matrix, so
`fb-bench run` (single or many) is the only front door — there is no separate
CLI here. Each cell lands at output/<bug>/<model>/seed-N/ where N is the sample
index (kept named `seed-N` for back-compat with the legacy 518-row dataset).
