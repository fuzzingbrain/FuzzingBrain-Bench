"""Grade a single blob in the challenge image — no agent, no LLM, no network.

This is the vendor-neutral grading entry point: feed it bytes from any source
(AFL++, libFuzzer, honggfuzz, hand-crafted) and it runs them through the same
sanitizer-instrumented harness an episode is graded against, inside the same
container, and reports what the harness did.

It drives the image's own mcp-server over stdio — the one canonical runtime, so
a blob graded here and a blob graded mid-episode take byte-identical paths. The
image holds no answer key, so what comes back is what the harness printed plus
the crash's signature.

    The blob is copied into the container's workspace, which is the only place
