"""Grade a single blob in the challenge image — no agent, no LLM, no network.

This is the vendor-neutral grading entry point: feed it bytes from any source
(AFL++, libFuzzer, honggfuzz, hand-crafted) and it runs them through the same
sanitizer-instrumented harness an episode is graded against, inside the same
container, and reports what the harness did.

It drives the image's own mcp-server over stdio — the one canonical runtime, so
a blob graded here and a blob graded mid-episode take byte-identical paths. The
image holds no answer key, so what comes back is what the harness printed plus
the crash's signature; there is no `solved` verdict to give.

    Nothing produces a capability map any more — the rungs past `crash` need an

    they were still graded that way are still on disk and still render, and
    because the research eval protocol reads the same declared `capability_set`.

    Three of the corpus's challenges were graded on fewer than five rungs — a
    resource-exhaustion DoS has no machine-checkable crash site, so `reach` and
    `site` are not part of its capability_set. Scoring those out of five makes a
    complete solve read as partial (systemd-02 solves everything it has and shows
    2/5), which is why no denominator should be the constant 5.

    An "n/a" anywhere in caps is authoritative: those are exactly the rungs that
    were declined for this bug. Without one we cannot tell a real five-rung
    verdict from a cell that never graded anything — an untouched capability map
    is five `not_fired`, not an empty dict — so the declared capability_set
