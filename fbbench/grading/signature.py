"""Turn one harness run's raw output into a stable crash signature.

A signature answers exactly one question: *are these two crashes the same bug?*
What is being identified is a CRASH, not a defect: two faults of different
kinds, or at different places, are different crashes, and whether they share an
underlying bug is not a question this layer answers. So everything that varies
between runs of the SAME fault (heap addresses, pids, allocation sizes, timings)
is stripped, while everything that locates the fault — class, function, file,
line — is kept.

    canon_sig = "class|func|func|func"

over the top three application frames. A frame is named by its FUNCTION and
nothing else — no file, no line, no module offset — so every component of a
signature is a name that can be searched for. The runtime entry (`main`,
`_start`) is not an application frame; see `_SKIP_FUNC` and `_key_part`.

The rules below are not guesses: each one was derived by running this module's
prototype over all 68 crash logs in the answers repo, and each failure it fixes
is named in the comment. See `_internal/CRASH-DEDUP.md` for the full write-up.

This lives in Python, not in the Go judge, on purpose. The raw output is
archived, so a rule change here re-derives every signature a pool has ever held
without re-running a single harness — and these rules WILL change, which is a
bad fit for a compiled binary. The judge decides *whether* a run crashed; this
decides *which* crash it was.

Two callers share this ONE file, which is why it is stdlib-only and standalone:

  * the grading backend, scoring sweeps server-side;
  * the self-contained challenge image, where it is baked at
    /opt/fbbench/signature.py and shelled out to by mcp-server (see the CLI at
    the bottom of this file).

Two implementations of "are these the same crash?" that drift apart produce
scores nobody can compare, so this is copied, never reimplemented. Keep it
importable with no package around it.
